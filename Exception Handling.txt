Exception Handling
----------------------------------------------
what is exception handling?
Exception handling in Java allows developers to manage runtime errors effectively by using mechanisms like try-catch block, finally block, throwing Exceptions, Custom Exception handling, etc.
without error handing what happen?
Problems without exception handling:
1)Abnormal Termination
2)System defined error messages
problems with exception handling?
1)normal Termination
2)user friendly error messages
---------------------------------------------------
what are the type of error?
1. compilation error
2. run time error
what is compilation error?
-->the program thow the error during compilation
Occurs before the program runs â€” during compilation.
-->Caused by syntax mistakes, missing files, wrong data types, etc.
eg
int a="hello";
what is run time error?
Occur during program execution
Occurs after the program has successfully compiled and is running.
Often caused by bad input, logic errors, or illegal operations.
eg
Division by zero
Null pointer access
int a=10/0 this is arihmetric exception

-----------------------------------------------------
Types of Exceptions
===================
We have 3 types of exceptions

1. Checked Exception-Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.
*FileNotFoundException
*ClassNotFoundExceptionA

2. Unchecked Exception--unChecked exceptions are checked at run-time.
*NullPointerException
*ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

3. Error-Computer system do not have enough memory to handle the Java
processing can give OutOfMemoryError.

what is error
Usually unrecoverable
error came from outside the control of the program.and caused by issues in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or system resource.
OutOfMemoryError-Not enough memory to run the program
------------------------------------------------------------
ok!how to manage or controll the errors?
in this concept we have try,catch,finally,throw,throws
what is try & catch block?
The code inside the try block is executed, and if any exception occurs, it is then caught by the catch block.
We can use multiple catch block with a single try.
try -->error code

catch -->handling code

what is finally
Java finally block can be used to execute important code such as closing connection,
piece of code is always executed whether an exception occurs or not.
Always executed after try-catch block.
finally -->cleanup code

what is throw?
Java throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.
The throw keyword is mainly used to throw custom exceptions. 
Throw is followed by an instance.n
Throw is used within the method.
Multiple exception cannot be thrown.
throw   -->to throw an error explicitly

what is throws?
throws  -->info to the caller/Informs the caller that this method might throw an exception
Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception.
Throws is used with the method signature.
Throws is followed by class.
Throws can declare multiple exceptions
-  Checked exception can be propagated with throws.
